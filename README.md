# ðŸšš Vehicle Routing Problem Solver (with Tkinter GUI)

A Python-based GUI tool to solve the **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)** using a simple **greedy algorithm**. Built with ðŸ’» Tkinter for the interface and ðŸ§  NumPy for matrix operations.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. Enter the number of locations (must be > 1).
2. Provide a name for each location.
3. Enter the distances between locations in a matrix (0s are auto-filled for same-location pairs).
4. Click **Save Matrix** â€“ the app finds and displays the best route using a greedy algorithm.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

- `Python`
- `Tkinter` (built-in Python GUI)
- `NumPy`
